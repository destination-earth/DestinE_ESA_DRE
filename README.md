# Destination Renewable Energy (DRE)

## Description

Destination Renewable Energy (DRE) is one of the Use Cases to be implemented as part of the Destination Earth Service Platform (DESP). Energy is at the heart of the challenge of achieving both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Renewable energy systems (solar and wind) are weather and climate dependent, so the transition to clean energy requires improved climate information and services for the energy sector. 
The main objective of DRE Use Case is to develop the Hybrid Renewable Energy Forecasting System (HYREF), a hybrid (solar and wind) application that could provide renewable energy forecasts in different time scales. It combines solar and wind energy to maximise the potential production and use of green electricity. HYREF  will act as a decision support system, aiming at maximising the use of DESP data and tools to provide actionable and meaningful information for policy and decision making in support of the green and digital transformation, using applications in the field of energy and climate change.
