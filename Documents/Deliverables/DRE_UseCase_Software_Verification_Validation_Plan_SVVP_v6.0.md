# System Overview

## System Description

**Data Sources and Integration**

The DRE Use Case leverages many high-resolution data sources to support the advanced forecasting and modeling of renewable energy systems. These include DestinE Digital Twin (DT) forecast data, the Weather-induced Extremes Digital Twin, Global Ocean 1/12Â° Physics Analysis and Forecast, the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Vegetation Indices, CORINE Land Cover, and the Global 10-daily Fraction of Vegetation Cover dataset.

These diverse datasets are integrated to construct a robust digital model that assesses both solar and wind energy systems' production potential and environmental impacts. The service also utilises Digital Twin and DEDL data to simulate realistic scenarios and support user-specific assessments. Due to current limitations in data availability from certain DESP services, the exact data inputs are further detailed in the relevant deliverables of the Use Case.

**Challenges to be Addressed**

The DRE system addresses the critical challenge of climate change and the urgent need to transition to clean energy systems. Because the last seven years have been the hottest on record, there is a growing demand for reliable and scalable climate services. Renewable energy systemsâparticularly solar and windâare inherently sensitive to atmospheric conditions, making accurate forecasting essential.

The DRE tackles this challenge by offering advanced assessments and 2-day solar radiation forecasts, wind speed, and power production forecasts. It also supports hybrid energy scenarios and "what-if" analyses within the Hybrid Renewable Energy Forecasting App (HYREF), empowering users to make informed decisions about system design, optimisation, and resilience to climate-induced risks.

**Proposed Solution: Hybrid Renewable Energy Forecasting System (HYREF)**

At the core of the DRE system is the HYREF, a user-friendly web application that digitises and simulates solar and wind energy production systems through Digital Twin technologies. HYREF combines real-world data, historical meteorological records, and high-resolution forecast models to create a Virtual DRE System for advanced simulations and scenario analysis.

The system supports user-specific data collection, including ingesting custom time series, enabling personalised forecasts and dynamic visualisations via time-series plots and dashboards. DRE Use Case software also ensures secure access through an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system while offering continuous support through a structured user helpdesk and comprehensive documentation

**Impact and Long-term Benefits**

The DRE system enhances short-term forecasting accuracy for solar and wind power, supporting the effective management of power grids with high penetration of renewables. These capabilities are vital for energy market operations, optimised asset allocation, and reducing integration costs.

Through active co-design with key stakeholdersâincluding energy providers, policymakers, and researchersâthe DRE maximises its relevance and usability across different sectors.

In the long term, the DRE contributes to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development goals and the Paris Agreement, supporting data-driven energy policy and climate adaptation strategies. It aligns with major EU initiatives, such as the European Green Deal, promoting renewable energy adoption and climate resilience. Integrating DestinE's advanced data infrastructure highlights the transformative role of digital modeling in achieving sustainable energy goals and supporting informed environmental decision-making.

# Verification Strategy

A Software Verification and Validation Plan (SVVP) is proposed to ensure the successful, reliable, and high-quality development of the DRE Use Case software. The plan defines a structured approach for verifying and validating the application's core functionalities, forecasting accuracy, and system performance. It includes quality control procedures, detailed testing scenarios, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to assess the software in realistic operational conditions. The SVVP also outlines the roles and responsibilities of the project team, supporting an efficient and collaborative validation process. User feedback will be actively collected and used to guide improvements, ensuring that DRE Use Case software meets the expectations of its end users and is ready for effective deployment.

## Risk Assessment

According to the guidelines, the strategy and extent of validation have to be identified following a risk-based approach. The risk level is determined through the Risk Assessment Index (RAI), whose evaluation is based on the application of the below two-dimensional parametric model, which foresees the assessment of the system:

-   Criticality (High, Medium, Low)
-   Complexity (High, Medium, Low)

The criticality and complexity of the system can be evaluated based on the answers to the questions defined in the following table:

# Reporting and Documentation

The reporting process for the Software Verification and Validation (V&V) activities will follow a structured, transparent, and standardised approach to ensure timely, accurate, and traceable dissemination of information.

## Reporting

All V&V reports will be prepared in a standardised digital format to ensure consistency, ease of distribution, and compatibility with various platforms. Each report will include a summary of validation and verification activities, test results, identified deviations from the plan, and key performance indicators such as error rates, test coverage, and system performance metrics.

Reports will be distributed to relevant DRE digital ecosystem teams, energy policymakers, and project managers for long-term traceability. Regular review meetings will be scheduled to discuss findings, address any issues, and align ongoing validation activities with the objectives of the DRE Use Case. This collaborative approach supports informed decision-making and continuous improvement.

## Documentation Standards

Documentation throughout the V&V process will adhere to strict standards for consistency, clarity, completeness, and compliance. All related documentsâincluding test plans, test cases, test results, and validation reportsâwill follow a unified structure using standardised templates to promote clear communication and ease of interpretation.

Key principles include:

**Comprehensive Coverage:** Documentation will cover the full V&V lifecycle, including testing strategies, methodologies, environments, tools used, results, and encountered issues.

**Version Control:** A versioning system will be applied to maintain document integrity, track changes over time, and ensure reference to the most current data.

**Regulatory Compliance:** All documentation will comply with applicable industry standards and best practices, particularly those related to renewable energy systems, forecasting platforms, and digital twin technologies.

This approach guarantees that the V&V process remains transparent, traceable, and aligned with project quality expectations.
