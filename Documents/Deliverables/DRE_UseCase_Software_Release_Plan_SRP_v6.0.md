# Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose of the document

The purpose of the Software Release Plan version 6.0 deliverable is to manage and guide the development and implementation of the digitised, predictive Hybrid Renewable Energy Forecasting System (HYREF) for Destination Renewable Energy (DRE) Use case, integrating physical solar and wind energy systems with their digital twin models to enhance decision-making in energy production, trade, and storage. This is the final version of the deliverable. It incorporates all updates made during each subsequent phase to reflect the current status of the Use Case. The Destination Renewable Energy (DRE) Use Case software application is called the Hybrid Renewable Energy Forecasting System (HYREF). Therefore, this document uses the terms DRE Use Case and HYREF interchangeably.

## 1.2 Brief overview and objectives of DRE Use Case

The DRE Use Case focuses on developing and upscaling the HYREF, a user-friendly web application designed to deliver accurate, real-time data and forecasts for solar and wind energy production. The core objective is to assist decision-makers in crafting well-informed strategies by providing detailed insights and data that reduce the uncertainty of weather-dependent renewable energy outputs.

The DRE service offers a forecasting suite that includes solar radiation assessment, wind power production assessment, and 2-day forecasts of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), solar production, wind speed, and power output. It also integrates hybrid solar and wind power forecasting for enhanced predictive accuracy. Solar and wind resource assessments rely on CAMS solar radiation and historical wind data, using parameters such as wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, humidity, and air density. This enables accurate energy yield estimation and supports location-based analysis through dedicated software.

The DRE models can further incorporate user-provided time series to improve forecast quality, tailoring simulations to specific solar and wind parks. Upscaling the initial implementation involves adding new methods, including data collocation, management of spatiotemporal limitations, and error identification based on user inputs and Digital Twin (DT) data.

The HYREF will be integrated into the DestinE platform, offering automated processing of solar and wind analysis through containerised services and leveraging DT and DestinE Data Lake (DEDL) resources. Outputs will be stored in databases or optimised file formats for quick retrieval and visualised dynamically through dashboards. Strong Identity and Access Management (IAM) protocols will secure user interactions.

By merging physical renewable energy systems with their digital counterparts through digital twins, the DRE Use Case enables dynamic simulation and projection services, playing a role in the broader transition to clean energy and global climate change mitigation efforts.

# Timeline and Milestones

DRE's timeline and milestones are carefully structured to ensure timely delivery and alignment with our strategic objectives. This section outlines the key milestones and deadlines that will guide the progression of our Use Case. It includes a detailed timeline that encapsulates all critical phases of the Use Case, from initial development to final deployment. Maintaining a clear timeline allows us to monitor progress, allocate resources efficiently, and identify potential delays early. This proactive approach will enable us to maintain momentum and stay on track to achieve our Use Case goals.

***

The following key milestones and deadlines will mark the DRE's development:

***

-   **Month 3:** Completion of the Infrastructure phase, including establishing data integration and system architecture.

Each milestone is associated with specific deliverables, responsible parties, and deadlines to ensure alignment across the team. For the 5th release, a dedicated Gantt diagram has been created to coordinate implementation and deployment activities among all DRE partners, leading up to the operational launch. In parallel, Serco has assigned corresponding tasks as Jira tickets to facilitate structured tracking and execution.

Project management tools and techniques such as Gantt charts and Jira workflows are used to monitor progress and ensure the timely completion of milestones. Weekly Use Case meetings and updates inform all partners of their responsibilities and upcoming deadlines.

In the event of delays or unforeseen challenges, the project management team can take corrective measures, including resource reallocation, timeline adjustments, or strategy revisions to maintain alignment with overall objectives. A structured timeline, clearly defined milestones, and integrated project management practices are essential for effectively coordinating and successfully delivering the DRE Use Case.

# Risk Management

***

Risk management is a component that ensures the successful execution of the DRE Use Case. This section delves into identifying potential risks that could impede our progress, ranging from technical challenges to external factors. We will outline each identified risk along with the corresponding mitigation strategies.

Our approach is designed to be proactive, aiming to minimise potential disruptions and ensure the smooth running of the Use Case. The emphasis on risk management underscores our commitment to delivering the Use Case effectively while maintaining the highest safety and compliance standards.

In the development of DRE, several risks have been identified, with corresponding mitigation strategies, and are the following:

-   **Technical Risks:** The complexity of integrating various data streams and algorithms presents significant technical challenges. To mitigate this, we will engage experienced developers and data scientists, utilise robust development frameworks, and conduct regular technical reviews. Another substantial risk is the availability of the DESP Core components. Suppose specific components (Authentication, data management, service orchestration, etc.) are not ready to deliver the plan releases on time. In that case, the DRE consortium will have to consider alternatives that allow the validation of the prototype application. These alternatives include but are not limited to the introduction of demo users and data as well as the setup of demonstration services in the backend, for example, concerning integration endpoints that will be restored as soon as the respective components are available.

***

-   **Data Security Risks:** Handling sensitive data from DESP and 3Es requires stringent security measures. We will implement industry-standard encryption and data protection protocols, conduct regular security audits, and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

***

-   **Project Management Risks:** Delays and budget overruns are common in complex projects. We will use agile project management techniques, maintain a flexible resource allocation strategy, and establish a clear communication plan to ensure timely delivery within the budget.

***

-   **Technical Compliance Risks:** Compliance with application development guidelines of the DESP platform will be pursued. In the case that the required application development components and user interface specifications are not provided in time for the DRE prototype deliverables, the consortium will use generic templates with appropriate user interface components aiming to adhere to the general colouring scheme of DESP and the hosted applications.

***

-   **User Acceptance Risks:** The final product will be validated by end-users. During the development process, we will involve key stakeholders, including QUEST ENERGY and WeMet, conducting user acceptance testing at each stage and employing co-creation methods integrated with Scrum methodology. The ENORA Innovation team will use the Unified Stakeholders' Needs Co-creation Process (ΑΕΝΕΑ)[^1] method to integrate continuous end-user feedback.
