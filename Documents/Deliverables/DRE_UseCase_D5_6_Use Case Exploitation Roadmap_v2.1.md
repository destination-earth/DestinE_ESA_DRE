This strategy ensures that the DRE Use Case's outcomes generate tangible value for stakeholders while contributing to the broader adoption of hybrid renewable energy systems.

***

***

**Key Elements of the Commercialisation Strategy**

In case the 3Es will not allow commercialisation via the platform, we could establish bilateral agreements e.g., with the Service provider (SERCO) or with the end-users (QUEST Energy and Unisystems Software Integrator member of QUEST Group), the cloud facilities provider (OVH), etc., so that when a user would like to use the paid tier, the user would purchase the service directly from NOA. Then NOA will purchase the respective resources, etc., from the platform and service providers.

1.  **Market Segmentation**  
    Renewable energy producers, traders, policymakers, infrastructure developers, and energy storage providers are the primary market segments for DRE. These stakeholders require advanced forecasting capabilities to optimise production, trading, and storage while supporting strategic planning and regulatory compliance.

***

Beyond these primary segments, the assessment capabilities of the DRE application, particularly in analysing solar and wind fields, can benefit a much broader range of end users. These include households, energy communities, farmers, sailors, and any individual users who can leverage the data to inform their decisions. When combined with the relevant Greek legislative framework, the system can assist users in evaluating the suitability of their land or production units, assessing investment potential, and optimising their energy generation strategies.

Furthermore, the application’s geographical scope can be extrapolated to cover wider areas, enhancing its applicability across different regions and user profiles.

For energy communities specifically, the DRE offers significant value by enabling them to share their energy portfolios with larger companies with the necessary technical expertise. Such users would benefit from knowing whether their production units operate under optimal conditions and whether their land is suitable for photovoltaic investments.

***

For smaller installations that participate in larger cooperative schemes and receive dividends annually, understanding the expected energy yield of their individual assets becomes essential. Access to accurate forecasts would help them assess whether to continue partnerships with their current energy providers or explore alternative options.

***

2.  **Value Proposition**  
    DRE offers precise, renewable energy forecasts (solar and wind) up to two days ahead with high spatial and temporal resolution. By integrating advanced hybrid modelling and decision-support capabilities, the system helps stakeholders reduce operational risks, maximise energy efficiency, and make informed investment decisions.

***

3.  **Day-Ahead Market in Maximising DRE’s Impact -** The Day-Ahead Market (DAM) plays a crucial role in the energy sector, enabling producers, aggregators, and suppliers to plan their operations and trading strategies accurately and efficiently. By submitting bids for the following day, market participants secure their positions and manage price volatility and production variability risks. For renewable energy stakeholders, especially those relying on variable sources such as solar and wind, accurate day-ahead forecasting is essential to optimise energy output, reduce imbalances, and minimise associated costs. Integrating advanced forecasting solutions, such as those developed in the DRE Use Case, directly supports market participation by improving forecast precision, enabling better decision-making, and enhancing competitiveness in an increasingly dynamic energy market.
