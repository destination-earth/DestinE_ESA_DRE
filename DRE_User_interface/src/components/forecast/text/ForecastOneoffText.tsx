      To generate accurate 2-day wind energy production forecasts, we invite you to upload your wind park data using our CSV template. This data allows our system to train a tailored prediction model based on your specific site conditions. Download the template below to get started! Before uploading your file, please ensure it meets all validation requirements. The file must be in CSV format and contain case-sensitive names and must match the template. The time (in utc) column must follow the ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2023-06-01T08:00:00Z or 2023-06-01 08:00:00), with time intervals exactly every hour, no duplicate timestamps, and no future timestamps beyond three days ago. The column corresponding to power (in kW) must contain only numerical values (floats) between 0 and 18.000. The file must not include any empty cells or text values in numeric fields. If any rule is violated, the entire file will be rejected. You will receive an error report indicating the row number and the type of issue, so you can correct the file and re-upload it.

      To accurately estimate wind power generation, please upload your turbine's power curve data. The CSV file must contain exactly two columns with the following case-sensitive names: <strong>wind_speed_in_m_s</strong> and <strong>power_output_in_kW</strong>. This data enables our system to calculate precise power output based on wind conditions at your selected location. Use our template below for the correct format.
